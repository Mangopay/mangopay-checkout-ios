This Terms of Service Agreement (the “SDK License” or “Agreement”), is an agreement between you (“You” or the “Client”), and Nethone sp. z o.o with its registered office in Warsaw, address: Plac Europejski 1, 00-844 Warsaw, Poland, entered in the register of entrepreneurs of the National Court Register kept by the District Court for the capital city of Warsaw, 12th Commercial Division of the National Court Register under KRS number 0000635459, Tax Identification Number (NIP) 5223070603, REGON number 365348186, share capital of PLN 131,600 ("Nethone", "We", or "Us"), for the provision of profiling services (the “Services”). As part of our Services we offer SDK software (the “SDK”). In order to use the SDK, you need to integrate it into your own mobile application(s) (“App(s)”), subject to the conditions set out herein.

The SDK and Your Use of Our Services

Pursuant to this SDK License, you are allowed to (i) use the latest version of our SDK, including data made available through it, for the sole purpose of integrating it with your App; and (ii) to distribute the integrated SDK together with your App through iOS and Android platforms. You understand that We may require you to use/update the then-current version of our SDK, as may be necessary for the proper provision of our SDK.
To use our Services, you must integrate SDK with your mobile application according to documentation. You may then download the SDK from Nethone artifact repository. This process is described in documentation.
To the extent it is necessary for the use of the Nethone SDK, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, limited, personal (non-transferable, non-assignable and non-sub licensable), revocable license to access and use the Nethone SDK and to integrate it with your App(s) within the scope and pursuant to limitations set up in these Terms.
With the exception of software, libraries and their codes owned by third parties and used by Nethone in the SDK based on open source licences or licensed from third parties, the Nethone SDK as a whole and its substantial parts, libraries and codes constitute Nethone’s exclusive intellectual property (“IP”). Nethone’s IP is made available to you pursuant to the terms of this SDK License and as such cannot be used for purposes other than integration into your App(s), pursuant to terms of this SDK License.
You are not allowed to copy, reproduce, modify, delete or amend, sell, lease or rent the Nethone SDK or any of its part, or to create and use any derivative works based on Nethone’s SDK, or allow third parties to create derivative works based on the SDK.
You are not allowed to assign any of your rights and obligations to any third party without prior consent of Nethone. You are not allowed to use the Nethone SDK in any manner that may breach any of the provisions of this SDK License or applicable provisions of law.
You acknowledge and agree that in the event of any infringement of Nethone’s IP rights by you, Nethone will be entitled, at our own discretion, to disable your access to the Nethone SDK and/or terminate your license to use it with an immediate effect.
We may modify, replace, or discontinue provision of the Nethone SDK, partially or entirely, at any time and at our sole discretion. All of these changes shall be immediately effective by direct communication to you, unless otherwise noted.

Minimum technical requirements

- iOS 11 or higher
or
- Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher

Data Protection obligations

You acknowledge that depending on applicable jurisdiction and on the type of services provided by you, end users may have to provide and opt-in consent to the collection of certain personal data, as enabled by our SDK. You are also aware that these or other measures required by local laws – in particular such as compliance with information obligations - have to be implemented in or provided through your App(s). In particular, this means that in case of the lack of the required opt-in, Nethone would automatically need to be blocked from collecting on your behalf any data of users who did not grant an opt-in consent.
You are aware that our SDK collects end user information as described in Data Guide which constitutes Attachment B.
Nethone does not warrant that the use of the SDK is compliant with the requirements of local privacy laws of your jurisdictions or jurisdictions you choose to distribute your App(s) in and collect user information in, and you agree to comply with any such requirements by performing an assessment of requirements and by implementing the necessary measures in your App. As a minimum, you undertake that you will ensure compliance with your local data protection requirements, in particular by making assessment as to:
(i) whether implementation of an opt-in consent before the collection of user data via SDK and your App(s) is necessary, for instance by integrating the possibility of an opt-in for the data collection in the starting screen of your App and by providing an opt-out link in the settings pane of your App, and
(ii) to have, and abide by, an appropriate privacy policy, providing at least (a) notice that you collect, use, share and store data about end users of your Apps; (b) information on types of tracking technologies used, as well as how to opt out of such tracking; (c) all the mandatory information required under applicable data protection legislation; this shall include information on purposes of collection of personal data (in particular notice on collection of data for antifraud purposes), legal basis of processing, as well as information of user rights (d) a description of the opt-in process (if applicable), and (e) opt-out option in such a manner that an end user can easily find it (if applicable), and
(iii) to obtain all end user consents, clearance and authorizations required by applicable law to use the App(s) in which SDK is implemented.
Our SDK supports recording of an opt-in before collecting the relevant end-user data from the end user’s mobile device. You shall safeguard that all measures regarding validity of the opt-in are taken by you so that the end-user data collected via your App(s) in the jurisdictions where you distribute your App(s) has been collected and can be processed by Nethone for the purposes of providing the SDK to you in full compliance with such laws.
You will not (and will not allow any third party to) (i) track or collect personal data of end users or (ii) sell App user’s personal data.

No Warranty, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification

THE SDK AND ANY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NETHONE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
In case the SDK shows a material defect, Nethone will use reasonable efforts to remedy such defect within a reasonable term following the receipt of your written notice.
Any liability of Nethone for damages towards you, regardless of whether such claims are based on contract, tort or otherwise, are limited to direct and proven losses, resulting from intentional harm or gross negligence. Nethone shall not in any case be held liable for loss of profit or indirect losses of any kind.
Nethone’s overall liability shall be, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, limited to the amount of remuneration paid by you for the past 12 months.
You warrant that You have obtained any and all consents, authorizations and clearances from end users to allow Nethone to collect, store, and use end user information as per the terms of this Agreement. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Nethone, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, penalties, settlements, judgments, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) arising from (i) your violation of the terms of this Agreement; (ii) any violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights resulting from the integration or use of the SDK together with your App or SDK; and (iii) any violation or failure by you to comply with all laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, whether or not described herein.
