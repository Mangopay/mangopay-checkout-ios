## Card Element

The Card Element offers a ready-made component that allows you to create your own card payment experience and tokenize card payment details. With our Card Element, you can easily incorporate a custom pay button and have control over the tokenization process.

When using Card Element, you still benefit from real-time card data validation, and the ability to customize the payment form.

### 1. Create an instance of the **MangoPayCheckoutForm** Payment Form

```swift
lazy var elementForm: MGPPaymentForm = {
        let form = MGPPaymentForm(
            paymentFormStyle: PaymentFormStyle(),
            supportedCardBrands: [.visa, .mastercard, .maestro]
        )
        return form
    }()
```

MGPPaymentForm

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| paymentFormStyle | PaymentFormStyle | Property for styling the payment form. |
| supportedCardBrands | Array<CardType> | The supported card brands listed above the payment form. |

### 2. Add payment form to your parent view and add the appropriate layout constraints

```swift
**self**.view.addSubview(elementForm)
```

### Using `MangopayCheckoutForm` with card tokenization

2.1 Create card Registration object as stated [here](https://www.notion.so/Checkout-SDK-iOS-4998a56debfe473089140e70186890bb?pvs=21)

2.2 Call tokenizeCard() when desired (Example when pay button was clicked)

```swift
    MangopayCoreiOS.tokenizeCard(
        form: elementForm,
        with: cardRegistration,
        presentIn: <presenting_view_controller>
    ) { respoonse, error in
            
      if let res = respoonse {
            //do something
      }
      
      if let err = error {
          //do something

## Handling ApplePay payment

<aside>
<img src="/icons/square-alternate_lightgray.svg" alt="/icons/square-alternate_lightgray.svg" width="40px" /> **Prerequisites**

To use the Mangopay Checkout SDK to accept ApplePay payment, you‚Äôll need to:

- [Create merchant identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-merchant-identifier)¬†in your Apple developer account
- [Register and validate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applepaywebmerchantregistrationapi/preparing_merchant_domains_for_verification) your merchant domain
- [Create a merchant identity certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay-on-the-web) associated with your merchantId
- [Set up your server](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/setting_up_your_server)¬†for secure communication with Apple Pay and [creating merchant sessions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/creating_an_apple_pay_session).
- Ask your CSM tot enable ApplePay
</aside>

To accept Apple Pay payments with Mangopay PaymentSheet, when creating an instance of the Checkout class, you can optionally include a `MGPApplePayConfig` object. This will display the ApplePay button in your payment form and handle the ApplePay tokenization process.

You will need to pass the ApplePay payment data provided by the Checkout to your Apple PayIn request from your backend. 

For more information, please refer to the "[PayIn with ApplePay" tutorial in the Mangopay documentation](https://mangopay.com/docs/tutorials/integration-guide-googlepay). 

```swift
let applePayConfig = MGPApplePayConfig(
          amount: 1,
          delegate: self,
          merchantIdentifier: "<merchant_id>",
          merchantCapabilities: .capability3DS,
          currencyCode: "<currency_code",
          countryCode: "<country_code",
          supportedNetworks: [
              .masterCard,
              .visa
          ]
       )

let paymentConfig = PaymentMethodConfig(cardReg: cardRegObj, applePayConfig: applePayConfig)

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
       callback: callback
   )
```

### ApplePay **parameters**

### Handling ApplePay result

```swift
extension ViewController: MGPApplePayHandlerDelegate {

    func applePayContext(didSelect shippingMethod: PKShippingMethod, handler: @escaping (PKPaymentRequestShippingMethodUpdate) -> Void) {
    }

    func applePayContext(didCompleteWith status: MangoPayApplePay.PaymentStatus, error: Error?) {
    }
}
```

## Process the payment

### Making card pay-ins

You can use a registered card (`CardId`) for pay-ins with the following objects:

- [The Direct Card PayIn object](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#direct-card-payin-object), for one-shot card payments
- [The Recurring PayIn Registration object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/recurring-card-payins#recurring-payin-registration-object), for recurring card payments
- [The Preauthorization object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/preauthorizations#preauthorization-object), for 7-day preauthorized card payments
- [The Deposit Preauthorization object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/preauthorizations#deposit-preauthorization-object), for 30-day preauthorized card payments

### Making GooglePay pay-ins

Include Google PaymentData provided by the Checkout in your Google PayIn: [PayIn with GooglePay](https://mangopay.com/docs/tutorials/integration-guide-googlepay#include-google-paymentdata-in-your-google-payin)

### Managing cards

You can use the following endpoints to manage cards: 

- [View a Card](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#view-card) provides key information about the card, including its `Fingerprint` which can be used as an [anti-fraud tool](https://mangopay.com/docs/concepts/payments/payment-methods/card/anti-fraud-tools#card-fingerprint)
- [Deactivate a Card](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#deactivate-card) allows you to irreversibly set the card as inactive

## **Handling redirection**

Some payment methods (card, PayPal) require or may require the user to be redirected to authorize or complete a transaction.

The Checkout SDK allows you to manage the entire payment flow seamlessly while retaining control over transaction logic in your backend. Once a payment method is selected and payment details are provided, use the `onCreatePayment` function to request the transaction from your backend.

Subsequently, and when necessary for the transaction type, the Checkout SDK seamlessly manages additional redirect actions for 3DS authorization or otherwise validating the payment.

To manage transaction redirects effectively with the SDK:

1. In your callback attribute, define an `onCreatePayment` attribute as a closure. The closure has `paymentMethod` and `attemptReference` as inputs and it returns the created card object
2. Within your function:
    1. Request a transaction from your server and subsequently, Mangopay. ( *you can pass in the attempt Reference in the request)*
    2. Return the unaltered transaction response object to the SDK.
3. The SDK:
    1. Redirects the user to the payment authentication page when necessary.
    2. Manages payment provider redirects back to the SDK.
    3. Triggers the `onPaymentComplete` event with the ID and status of the transaction.
    4. Confirms the redirect result on your server by invoking the corresponding GET API of the transaction.
    5. Presents the payment result to the user.
    

**Redirection example**

```swift
            callback: CallBack(
                 onCreatePayment: { paymentMethod, attemptRef in
                     // 1. implement server-side call to request a transaction (with the attempt reference).
                                     // 2. return the card transaction object.
                                     return <Card_Transaction_Object>
                 }
             )
    
```

## **Present the payment result**

```kotlin
    
Checkout Screen  -> Payment sheet -> Confirmation screen 

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
           paymentMethodOptions: paymentConfig,
           branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
           callback: CallBack(
               onTokenizationCompleted: { cardRegistration in
                                    **//dismiss the payment sheet**
                                     self.checkout.teardown()
                                    **//present the confirmation screen**
               },
               onError: { error in
               },
               onSheetDismissed: {
               }
           )
       )

       checkout.present(in: self)
```

## Customizing the Checkout
