## Creating a Card Registration

In your backend, create a Card Registration via the Mangopay API, using the `Id` of the end user as the `UserId` .

You must also define the currency and type of the card at this stage.

<aside>
<img src="/icons/square-alternate_gray.svg" alt="/icons/square-alternate_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **POST** /v2.01/`ClientId`/cardregistrations

```json
{
    "Tag": "Created with the Mangopay Vault SDK",
    "UserId": "142036728",
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "Currency": "EUR"
}
```

[See parameter details ‚Üí](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#create-card-registration)

</aside>

### API response

```json
{
    "Id": "193020188",
    "Tag": null,
    "CreationDate": 1686147148,
    "UserId": "193020185",
    "AccessKey": "1X0m87dmM2LiwFgxPLBJ",
    "PreregistrationData": "XBDYiG8w9PrylPS01KmupZunmK2QRHKIC-yUF6il3aIpAnKba1TGkR9VJe5lHjHt2ddFLVXdicolcUIkv_kKEA",
    "RegistrationData": null,
    "CardId": null,
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "CardRegistrationURL": "https://homologation-webpayment.payline.com/webpayment/getToken",
    "ResultCode": null,
    "ResultMessage": null,
    "Currency": "EUR",
    "Status": "CREATED"
}
```

The data obtained in the response will be used in the `CardRegistration` configuration of of the Checkout.

## Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your `ClientId` and select your environment (Sandbox or Production). 

```swift
MangopayCheckoutSDK.initialize(clientId: "<client_id>", environment: .sandbox)
```

### Initialization parameters

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clientId | String | MGPEnvironment |
| environment | Environment | Expected backend environment.

Default value: Environment.SANDBOX

Allowed values:Environment.SANDBOX, Environment.PRODUCTION |

## Configure and present the PaymentSheet

1. **Create a Checkout Sheet instance in your ViewController**
    
    ```swift
    var checkout: MGPPaymentSheet!
    ```
    
2. **Create a payment handler/ Callbacks**

```swift
    let callback = CallBack(
         onPaymentMethodSelected: { paymentMethod in
         },
         onTokenizationCompleted: { cardRegistration in
         }, onPaymentCompleted: {
         }, onCancelled: {
         },
         onError: { error in
         },
         onSheetDismissed: {
         }
     )
```

<aside>
üö® The Checkout has an integrated fraud profiler that performs background checks and collects data on the payer's device to assess transaction risk.

On successful card tokenization, the SDK provides a `fraudProfilerId`. When making a PayIn request, add this as `ProfilingAttemptReference` to enable fraud protection.

</aside>

1. Create a paymentMethodConfig object

```swift
let paymentConfig = PaymentMethodConfig(cardReg: cardRegObj)
```

1. Initialize **the PaymentSheet**

```swift
checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       handlePaymentFlow: false,
       branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
       callback: callback
   )
```

1. Present the payment Sheet

```swift
checkout.present(in: self)
```

### PaymentMethodConfig Parameters

Card configuration parameters

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| card | MGPCardInfo | Card Information Object |
| cardReg | MGPCardRegistration | Card Registration Object |

## Card Element

The Card Element offers a ready-made component that allows you to create your own card payment experience and tokenize card payment details. With our Card Element, you can easily incorporate a custom pay button and have control over the tokenization process.

When using Card Element, you still benefit from real-time card data validation, and the ability to customize the payment form.

### 1. Create an instance of the **MangoPayCheckoutForm** Payment Form

```swift
lazy var elementForm: MGPPaymentForm = {
        let form = MGPPaymentForm(
            paymentFormStyle: PaymentFormStyle(),
            supportedCardBrands: [.visa, .mastercard, .maestro]
        )
        return form
    }()
```

MGPPaymentForm

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| paymentFormStyle | PaymentFormStyle | Property for styling the payment form. |
| supportedCardBrands | Array<CardType> | The supported card brands listed above the payment form. |

### 2. Add payment form to your parent view and add the appropriate layout constraints

```swift
**self**.view.addSubview(elementForm)
```

### Using `MangopayCheckoutForm` with card tokenization

2.1 Create card Registration object as stated [here](https://www.notion.so/Checkout-SDK-iOS-integration-guide-4998a56debfe473089140e70186890bb?pvs=21)

2.2 Call tokenizeCard() when desired (Example when pay button was clicked)

```swift
    MangopayCoreiOS.tokenizeCard(
        form: elementForm,
        with: cardRegistration,
        presentIn: <presenting_view_controller>
    ) { respoonse, error in
            
      if let res = respoonse {
            //do something
      }
      
      if let err = error {
          //do something
      }
  }
```

<aside>
<img src="/icons/square-alternate_lightgray.svg" alt="/icons/square-alternate_lightgray.svg" width="40px" /> **Prerequisites**

To use the Mangopay Checkout SDK to accept ApplePay, you‚Äôll need to:

- [Create merchant identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-merchant-identifier)¬†in your Apple developer account
- [Register and validate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applepaywebmerchantregistrationapi/preparing_merchant_domains_for_verification) your merchant domain
- [Create a merchant identity certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay-on-the-web) associated with your merchantId
- [Set up your server](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/setting_up_your_server)¬†for secure communication with Apple Pay and [creating merchant sessions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/creating_an_apple_pay_session).
- ApplePay enabled by your CSM
</aside>

To accept Apple Pay payments with Mangopay PaymentSheet, when creating an instance of the Checkout class, you can optionally include a `MangopayApplePayConfig` object. This will display the ApplePay button in your payment form and handle the ApplePay tokenization process.

You will need to pass the ApplePay payment data provided by the Checkout to your Apple PayIn request from your backend. 

For more information, please refer to the "[PayIn with ApplePay" tutorial in the Mangopay documentation](https://mangopay.com/docs/tutorials/integration-guide-googlepay). 

```swift
let applePayConfig = MangopayApplePayConfig(
          amount: 1,
          delegate: self,
          merchantIdentifier: "<merchant_id>",
          merchantCapabilities: .capability3DS,
          currencyCode: "<currency_code",
          countryCode: "<country_code",
          supportedNetworks: [
              .masterCard,
              .visa
          ]
       )

let paymentConfig = PaymentMethodConfig(cardReg: cardRegObj, applePayConfig: applePayConfig)

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
       callback: callback
   )
```

    }

    func applePayContext(didCompleteWith status: MangoPayApplePay.PaymentStatus, error: Error?) {
    }
}
```

## Process the payment

### Making card pay-ins

You can use a registered card (`CardId`) for pay-ins with the following objects:

- [The Direct Card PayIn object](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#direct-card-payin-object), for one-shot card payments
- [The Recurring PayIn Registration object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/recurring-card-payins#recurring-payin-registration-object), for recurring card payments
- [The Preauthorization object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/preauthorizations#preauthorization-object), for 7-day preauthorized card payments
- [The Deposit Preauthorization object](https://preview-documentation.swarm.preprod.mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/preauthorizations#deposit-preauthorization-object), for 30-day preauthorized card payments

### Making GooglePay pay-ins

Include Google PaymentData provided by the Checkout in your Google PayIn: [PayIn with GooglePay](https://mangopay.com/docs/tutorials/integration-guide-googlepay#include-google-paymentdata-in-your-google-payin)

### Managing cards

You can use the following endpoints to manage cards: 

- [View a Card](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#view-card) provides key information about the card, including its `Fingerprint` which can be used as an [anti-fraud tool](https://mangopay.com/docs/concepts/payments/payment-methods/card/anti-fraud-tools#card-fingerprint)
- [Deactivate a Card](https://mangopay.com/docs/endpoints/direct-card-payins#deactivate-card) allows you to irreversibly set the card as inactive

## ****Handle 3D Secure authentication (optional)****

When you request a PayIn from your server, the response will contain a `SecureModeNeeded` field indicating if 3D Secure authentication is required by the payer.

To complete 3D Secure authentication, redirect shoppers to the authentication page using the 3DS Component. When the shopper returns to your app, make a **GET**  **`/v2.01/**ClientId**/<payInType>/**PayInId` request from your server to verify the status of the payment.

You can find an example of handling 3DS redirect flow using our SDK in the¬†`HandleThreedsActivity.tk`¬†file from the¬†[Mangopay iOS SDK examples](https://github.com/Mangopay/mangopay-android-sdk-examples)**.**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è It is important that you call GET payIn from your backend (with respect to the payInType) to verify the status of the payment.

The success callback will provide you with a PayIn type and PayIn to make the request.

```swift
let _3dsVC = ThreeDSController(
      secureModeReturnURL: <"secure_mode_url">,
      secureModeRedirectURL: "secure_mode_redirect_url",
